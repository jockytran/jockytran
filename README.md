## UFC Predictor

This repository includes a simple Python script (`predictor.py`) for training and running a logistic regression model to predict UFC fight outcomes. The model requires a CSV dataset containing fighter statistics and a binary result column.

Example usage:

```bash
python predictor.py train training_data.csv
python predictor.py predict upcoming_fights.csv
```

The script is for demonstration purposes only and does **not** guarantee accurate predictions or financial gain.
